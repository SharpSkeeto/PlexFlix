# Plex FLix (MyPlexManager)

Personal project for learning WinUI 3 (XAML) and Plex APIs.
There is a much room for improvement and learning.

I have learned to approach projects for learning is to:
1.  get it to work
2.  improve maintainability
3.  make it more efficient
4.  make it look good

I'm still at step 1.  Maybe between step 1 and 2. :smiley:
