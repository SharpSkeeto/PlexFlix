# Plex Flix (MyPlexManager)

Personal project for learning WinUI 3 (XAML) and Plex APIs using my personal Plex server and content for data.
There is much room for improvement.

I have learned to approach projects for learning by:
1.  get it to work
2.  improve maintainability
3.  make it more efficient
4.  make it look good

I'm still at step 1.  :eyes:

### To Dos
1.  Proper Plex authentication
2.  Proper configuration functionality
3.  Picture library support
4.  Add lists to Home screen
5.  Add recommends and collection views as sub navigation items
6.  Remove the test player buttons above the settings menu item
7.  More things...
